        <h1 class="header">About</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">I'm a 22-year-old currently pursuing studies in Australia at North Metropolitan TAFE to achieve the Diploma of Information Technology. My journey into the world of started when I encountered the iPhone 4s in the year 2011, which was created by Steve Jobs. This was a game-changer for me, as it was my first experience with a smartphone with a touch display. This inspired me to aspire to design something similar in the future or even work for Apple.

            I gained more interest in programming when I was studying Telecommunication Engineering, where C programming was one of my core units. It quickly became clear that programming was my passion, and I found myself drawn to the world of coding.

            With each step of my academic journey, I aim to enhance my skills and knowledge, working towards a future where I can contribute to innovative projects and perhaps, one day, be part of the amazing team at Apple.
